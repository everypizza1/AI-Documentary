Part 0: `Intro`  
*Text:*  
`AI: A DOCUMENTARY`  
PG: Hello, welcome to this documentery! I'm PizzaTheGreat.  
PG: Today I will be talking about AI.

Part 1: `What is AI?`  
*Text:*  
`What is AI?`  
PG: I will be discussing what AI is in this section.  
PG: AI, also known as Artificail Intelligence, has recently become extremly popular.  
PG: You almost definitly have heard of it.  
PG: Recently, the world has recovered from a `AI Winter.`  
PG: AI winters happen because of AI development seeming too good to be true.  
PG: Recently, OpenAI made DALL-E, which became Craiyon. OpenAI also made DALL-E 2, which is much better.  
PG: You might also know about ChatGPT.  
PG: ChatGPT is a Generative Pre-trained Transformer.  
PG: This means that it can turn words into more words.  
PG: On to the next part!

Part 2: `Where is it used?`
PG: Nowadays, AI is used almost everywhere.  
PG: Some examples are: `(on-screen)`
- Home assistants
    - Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, etc. 
- Smart devices
- Writing
- Code
- Inspiration
- Google/Apple Maps
- Much more  

PG: AI is also being used in cars.  
PG: You probably have heard of Tesla, which was recently bought by Elon Musk.  
PG: In his new, but possibly illegal self driving 2.0, it uses very advanced AI to navigate.  
PG: AI is also used for `Reccomended` algoritims. We will discuss this in the next block.

Part 3: `What is its power?`  
PG: AI can get very powerful.  
PG: Theese short video clips will demonstrate that.  
`insert AI clips here (snake)`  
PG: Twoards the end, the AI got really good at the game.  
PG: Here are some images AI generated:
`insert images+prompt+engine here (bad tier)`  
PG: As you can see, theese images are poorly generated. Some have weird faces, hands or just don't look right.  
`insert images+prompt+engine here (moderate)`  
PG: Theese look better, but not the best. If you have a more detailed prompt, it looks even better.  
`insert images+prompt+engine here (best)`  
PG: As you can see, AI art can get creepily realistic.  
PG: AI is also pretty good at writing, sadly. At this point, you can't tell if an essay is real or stolen from an AI.  
PG: AI Text To Speech is also really good, as it has existied since 1961.  
PG: The main problem with AI is the price.  
PG: Most of the time, you need a good CPU, GPU, lots of RAM and a lot of storage space.  
PG: AI is also used in reccomended algorihims.  
PG: Ad personolisation depends on AI.  
PG: Whenever you click on a link or watch a video, it tells a server somwhere that you clicked on a link or watched a video.  
PG: It then analyses the video or webpage and shows you ads related to it.  
PG: If you press like or stay on the page for a certain ammount of time, that also gets sent to the serever.  
PG: If you press dislike, it gets sent to the server that you disliked the video.  
PG: Some other stuff sent to the server is:  

- Your adress
- Where you where when you pressed like
- Your IP adress
- Your name
- Much more  
  
PG: The AI uses that data to show you more things that you might like.  
PG: AI is also used in gaming.  
PG: Some people like to play chess against AI.  
PG: AI powers NPC's, or Non-Player Characters. Somtimes they have random movements, but sometimes they can also be programmed to find players.  
PG: There are many types of AI, most of which take too long to cover for me to fit them in this video.  
PG: One that I can fit in is Reinforcement Learning `(RL)` AI.  
PG: One example is the Snake game shown earlier that learns by itself.  
PG: RL algorithms are trained with a reward-based system, kind of like training a dog.  
PG: When it does something good, it gets a **reward.**  
PG: When it doesn't, it gets a **penalty.**  
PG: Rewards and penalties apply at the end of every **episode.**  
PG: The AI tries to get the highest possible **reward.**  
PG: Another use is spam classification.  
`insert 'spam warning' images here`  
PG: Spam protection saves many computers from malware.  
PG: Antivirus software is also powered by AI.  
PG: Antivirus works by scanning your files and comparing them to a database of malware.  
PG: If the file is simalar, it warns you and prevents it from infecting your computer.  
PG: Search engines also use AI.  
PG: Search engines compare your search term to a database.  
PG: The final use of AI I will cover is message classification.  
PG: On Gmail, there are tabs for Promotions, Primary, Updates and Socail.  
PG: There is a database of emails catagorised with each catogory.  
PG: It compares your email to the datbase and sorts them.  
PG: Google Messages has a simalar feature, but with Buisness and Personal catogories.
